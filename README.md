# Demergence

The appearance of emergent properties of decentralized systems.

Decentralization is fascinating. Struggles over its proper use have been present since the beginning of mankind. It manifests itself socially, in war, in business, in politics, in technology, and beyond. It has been inextricably connected with the human condition, and has potential to do great good and great harm.

We will explore the topic of decentralization and its emergent properties and effects, focusing on crypto-networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.

The world is changing. Inform yourself and change it for the better.
