                Jordan Last, Ryan Horne, and the community discuss an idea we are calling logarithmic voting for the Internet Computer.

            <title>Demergence Episode 5 - Deterministic vs Optimistic Decentralization</title>

                I discuss the idea of deterministic decentralization as implemented by the Internet Computer and Chainlink.
                I contrast that with what I call optimistic decentralization as implemented by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other blockchains.

                I think these could be existential threats to the Internet Computer's success.
                Agree?
                1. The NNS is unable to decentralize sufficiently
                2. Subnets are unable to decentralize sufficiently
                3. ICP is declared a security by the SEC
                4. Ethereum adopts chain key -> fantastic sharding

                Demergence Episode 2! I ramble through the idea of blockchains as protocols, protocol domains, and the decentralization, security, and scalability of Ethereum and the Internet Computer and what that means for their possible futures.

                The second episode of Demergence! We discuss privacy on the Internet Computer, diving into the differences between security of data and privacy of data, and what privacy looks like on centralized cloud providers, Ethereum and other blockchains, and the Internet Computer.
